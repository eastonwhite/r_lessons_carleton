$$ y = \mu + \beta*x_i $$

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_data.csv")

summary(gapminder)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.cap='My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure My really cool figure'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data= gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```



There results are really cool. I see that the mean life expectancy for Asia is `r mean(gapminder$lifeExp[gapminder$continent=='Asia'])`.
